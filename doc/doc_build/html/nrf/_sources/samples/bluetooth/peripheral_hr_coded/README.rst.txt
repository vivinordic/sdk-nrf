The Peripheral Heart Rate Monitor with Coded PHY offers similar functionality to the :ref:`zephyr:peripheral_hr` sample from Zephyr.
However, this sample supports LE Coded PHY.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-sample-yaml::

.. include:: /includes/hci_rpmsg_overlay.txt

The sample also requires a device running a Heart Rate Server with LE Coded PHY support to connect to.
For example, another development kit running the :ref:`bluetooth_central_hr_coded` sample.

Overview
********

The sample demonstrates a basic Bluetooth® Low Energy Peripheral role functionality that exposes the Heart Rate GATT Service with LE Coded PHY support, which is not available in Zephyr Bluetooth LE Controller (See :ref:`ug_ble_controller` for more information).
Once it connects to a Central device, it generates dummy heart rate values.
You can use it together with the :ref:`bluetooth_central_hr_coded` sample.

User interface
**************

The user interface of the sample depends on the hardware platform you are using.

LED 1:
   Blinks when the main loop is running (that is, the device is advertising) with a period of two seconds, duty cycle 50%.

LED 2:
   Lit when the development kit is connected.

Building and running

.. include:: /includes/build_and_run.txt


Testing
=======

After programming the sample to your development kit, you can test it by connecting to another development kit that runs the :ref:`bluetooth_central_hr_coded`.

1. |connect_terminal_specific|
#. Reset the kit.
#. Program the other kit with the :ref:`bluetooth_central_hr_coded` sample.
#. Wait until the Coded advertiser is detected by the Central.
   In the terminal window, check for information similar to the following::

      Connected: xx.xx.xx.xx.xx.xx (random), tx_phy 4, rx_phy 4

#. In the terminal window, observe that notifications are enabled::

      <inf> hrs: HRS notifications enabled
